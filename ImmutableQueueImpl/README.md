1. Coding task: 
            
            Please find few points regarding the immutable queue implemention.

    a. Immutable Queue is implemented by using immutable stack. The reasons I have choose stack over other 
    data structure are : 
            
            i) The memory management is better then other data structure. Since CPU organizes stack memory so efficiently 
            reading from stack and writing to stack is very fast.
               
            ii) It is very efficient navigating tree structure.
            
            iii) To implement Immutability of Queue it is lot easier andconvinient compare to other data structure.
     
    b. In pom.xml junit dependency is added. 
    
    c. please run **mvn test** project to execute the unit test cases.
